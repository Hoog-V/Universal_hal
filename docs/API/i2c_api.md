# I2C API

## Platform compatibility:

The standard I2C API for this framework has basic I2C Master and I2C Slave functionality. However not every platform has I2C peripherals or supports both I2C Master and I2C Slave functionality.

| Platform   | I2C Master support  | I2C Slave support   | HW peripheral/Bitbanged |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Atmel SAMD | ✔                   | ✔                   | HW peripheral           |
| RPI RP2040 | Not yet implemented | Not yet implemented | HW peripheral           |
